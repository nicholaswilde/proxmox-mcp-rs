# Project Context: proxmox-mcp-rs

## Project Overview
This project aims to be a **Rust implementation of a Proxmox MCP (Model Context Protocol) server**. It is designed to interface with a Proxmox virtualization environment, likely to expose its resources or control capabilities via the MCP standard.

**Current Status:** The project appears to be in an early initialization stage or undergoing a migration.
*   **Intended Language:** Rust (evidenced by `README.md` and `.gitignore`).
*   **Missing Components:** No `Cargo.toml` or `src/` directory is currently present in the root.
*   **Artifacts:** Existing logs (`proxmox_mcp_pve*.log`) suggest previous execution traces, potentially from a Python-based implementation or prototype (indicated by `urllib3` references in logs).

## Key Files
*   `README.md`: Declares the project as a Rust implementation.
*   `.gitignore`: Standard Rust gitignore file (generated by Cargo).
*   `proxmox_mcp_pve*.log`: Log files showing connection attempts to a Proxmox host (192.168.2.128). Use these for reference regarding connection parameters or expected behavior.

## Building and Running
*To be implemented once the Rust project structure is initialized.*

### Intended Workflow (Rust)
Once `Cargo.toml` is present:
1.  **Build:** `cargo build`
2.  **Run:** `cargo run`
3.  **Test:** `cargo test`

### TODOs
*   Initialize the Rust project: `cargo init`
*   Verify if the logs belong to this project or a reference implementation.

## Development Conventions
*   **Language:** Rust
*   **Style:** Standard Rust formatting (`rustfmt`) and linting (`clippy`) are expected.
